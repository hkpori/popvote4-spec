# POPVote Open Sources

POPVote is a simple, pragmatic, and secure system for polling in physical voting stations.

It is created by The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) for large-scale electronic
polling. It is designed for non-government and unofficial polling as a mean to measure and express
public opinions in authoritarian regimes. In consideration of the politically-sensitive nature, the
system must guarantee strong privacy to the voters.

The current version is design and develop for physical voting stations of Hong Kong's Democratic
Party Primaries in the 2020 Legislative Council election, but the system is designed to be useful
beyond that and to support voting over the Internet like previous POPVote (2014 Civil Referendum
Project).

The team are open-sourcing the specification in Apache 2 license, and we wish it will provide
transparency to the design, security and trade-off of the system to different stakeholders.

The team plan to open sources and license the software after the Primaries completed in Jul 2020.
